## Project Overview

### Part 1: Bulk Sequencing Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify molecular deficiencies in knockout vs. control mouse models for a neurological disease.
- **Tools Used:** Kallisto, tximport, DESeq2.
- **Key Methods:** Differential expression analysis, functional gene clustering.

### Part 2: Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis
- **Objective:** Predict patient response to immunotherapy using breast cancer biopsy data.
- **Tools Used:** Python, R, spatial visualization libraries.
- **Key Methods:** Cell type classification, spatial data analysis.
